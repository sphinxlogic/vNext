%% Can the following section move to the appendix? -E

%% I don't think the following example is worth the trouble -E
%% Let's have a look at another example:
%% \vccInput[linerange={begin-}]{c/02_rand.c}
%% \noindent
%% The reason we needed to use unchecked cast here, is that the C library
%% \vcc{rand()} function is specified to return a signed integer.

%% \begin{note}
%% In fact, the C standard, mandates the following specification:
%% \begin{VCC}
%% int rand(void)
%%   _(ensures 0 <= \result && \result <= RAND_MAX);
%% \end{VCC}
%% Thus, in principle the \vcc{_(unchecked)} shouldn't be required in the
%% example above. 
%% However,
%% VCC currently does not come with specifications for C standard library functions.
%% We plan to setup a open-source project, where you'll be able to contribute such
%% specifications.
%% It is indeed unclear why does it return a signed integer, only to ensure that the return value
%% is never negative.
