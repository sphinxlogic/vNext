# Project's PostBuildEvent uses FSharp tools:
dependency ..\..\fsharp\fslex.exe
dependency ..\..\fsharp\fsyacc.exe
dependency ..\..\fsharp\fsc.exe
dependency ..\..\fsharp\FSharp.Core.dll
dependency ..\..\fsharp\FSharp.Compiler.dll

# Project's PostBuildEvent takes the following inputs to create the output:
dependency lex.fsl
dependency parse.fsy
dependency parse_util.fs
dependency parser.fs
dependency ..\..\fsharp\FSharp.PowerPack.dll

# We don't list parser.dll as an output here because the project file already believes it is creating it.
