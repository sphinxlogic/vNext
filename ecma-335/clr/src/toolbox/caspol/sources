# build lab machines have logic to turn this off - see VBL\Tools\devdiv2.def.
# Also, make sure that obsolete methods aren't blocking errors.
# During an integration, if treating warnings as errors ever becomes a serious
# problem that can't be avoided, feel free to turn the problematic warnings
# back into errors using CSC_FLAGS=$(CSC_FLAGS) /warnaserror-:<error num>
