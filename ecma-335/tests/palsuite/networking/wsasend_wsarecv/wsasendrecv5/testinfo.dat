Name = Positive Test for WSARecv, WSASend, WSAGetOverlappedResult, PAL_CreateIoCompletionPort, PostQueuedCompletionStatus, GetQueuedCompletionStatus
TYPE = DEFAULT
EXE1 = wsasendrecv5
Description
= This test is similar to wsasendrecv4.c. It simulates multiple access

= to a server using multiple client threads. The main function thread

= serves for accepting connection from client threads. The main function

= also creates an IO completion port and 5 worker threads to handle data

= exchange with clients. Every client will wait
= few seconds to get a chance to connect to the server. If a failure
= occurs with a client, the test continues and an error will be 
= triggered by a call to Fail() at the end of the main thread. This 
= rocedure insures that all allocated handle and ressources are 
= unallocated. The amount of data transfered are known by the server
= and the client. As soon as they have the expected number of bytes
= received, they will stop receiving data and start replying on the 
= the same socket.
