/* This test is FINISHED.  Note:  The biggest feature of this function is that
   it locks the value before it increments it -- in order to make it so only 
   one thread can access it.  But, I really don't have a great test to make 
   sure it's thread safe. Any ideas?  Nothing I've tried has worked.
