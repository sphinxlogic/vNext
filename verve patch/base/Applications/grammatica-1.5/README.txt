GRAMMATICA README
=================

1. Introduction
---------------

  Grammatica is a C# and Java parser generator (compiler compiler).
  It reads a grammar file (in an EBNF format) and creates well-
  commented and readable C# or Java source code for the parser. It
  supports LL(k) grammars, automatic error recovery, readable error
  messages and a clean separation between the grammar and the source
  code.
